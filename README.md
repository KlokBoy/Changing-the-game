# Changing-the-game
DApp that can democratise creative briefs for the advertising industry.
How does it work:

- Coin 1: Advertiser coin which is created when a creative brief is minted on the network. Coins then evenly distributed to people working on the project. It's important coins are distributed to people who are responsible for the brand ultimately. Brands can choose to remain anonymous for safety.  

- Coin 2: Creator coins which are minted when you sign up as a creator and mint responses. These coins can used like social money on the network used to reward other creators for feedback, suggestions or even having an input with the response. 

- Creator can then bid on the brief with their tokenised response. This will create an open market where someone with a low reputation may have a better idea than someone with a higher reputation and charge less to obtain the work.  

- Advertisers coins are then used to vote for the best response. Majority wins. 

- Response with the most votes receives approval to start work and also receives advertiser coins used in the vote.

- Advertiser coins are then used as a ‘store of value’ to rank the creators who are part of the network. Increasing their reputation and ability to price their work according. i.e. someone with more advertiser coins has more clout to charge higher rates, as it shows their work has been accepted in the past.
